ARCHITECTURE
============
- Android App
- AWS/Bluemix
- Python App

UX
==
- User creates a session, and we give them a list of songs. 
- User then swipes for yes/no of tracks
- Each aditional user also will swipe
- We get back a list of songs tagged yes/no
- At the end of each song/after a vote, run algo to check what the next song should be
- As new songs get added, user gets notified and they can make decisions.
- Ability to leave session. 
- Wishlist
- Choose songs, save friendships
- QR code for playlists/name for playlist
- Branch for deep linking to Android (YAY HOODIE)
